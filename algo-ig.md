# How to make the algorithm work for you on Instagram


## Introduction

I've seen many of us feel like our voices are drowning in a sea of content; that you constantly have to be fighting people who are (sometimes) paid to spew vitriol and that the system is rigged against you.

There’s good news — mega corporations find it hard to control behavior at scale. It’s not easy to model behavior. Companies optimize for engagement and screen time, and it's hard to censor people when the content that you censor helps your bottom line. While we can’t control everyone’s behavior, understanding how these algorithms work can certainly change how we operate online to keep the resistance alive, and defend our content against malicious actors.

## Making content highly desirable to the algorithm

When you load up your feed, the content presented to you is curated using an algorithm. This takes a lot of signals into account, that are calculated offline prior to you loading your feed. Examples of this are the posts you’ve liked or shared. boost things that you want to see. Think about the most viral content on Instagram. Jokes, memes, celebrity news, and fitness content. It’s really easy to recommend this content to others rather than political content, because of the constant engagement that this content gets. This is harder to achieve with educational or political content. Corporations will always steer towards content that gets more eyes on the platform. Here are some of the things that you can do:

## Boost engagement metrics on content
- Like the content (everything can be liked, and it’s the simplest, most available signal that the algorithm has). Like posts, reels, stories, comments on posts, even reactions to stories
- Watch the WHOLE post/reel/story, more than once if you can (think of how many times you watch a funny meme). Pro tip: IG cannot track your eye movements, so leaving someone’s live video open is better than closing your app. More viewers means the video gets recommended more.
- Share content to your story, and engage with stories that your friends post. Like them, “react” to them and send a comment to your friends. Pro tip: It could be literally any comment — it’s easier to build a signal around whether or not a message/reaction has been sent to your friend, rather than building a signal on what the comment means.
- Sharing content to others over IG messages (sending it to a concrete user tells us something about both users and the share-ability of the content. Think about how many memes we send to our friends, and how that affects the desirability of the meme to the algorithm.)
- Like comments. This makes those comments higher-ranked, and signals that this video is particularly engaging enough to bring you into the comments section.  There are only a few spots in the first “page” of comments, so be intentional about supporting accurate, authentic and kind comments.
- Spend some time scrolling the comments section. The time you spend here also matters. Spend at least a few seconds reading through the first page of comments.
- Sharing the content out of Instagram, using the “Share” button (tells us that this content is relevant not only in IG, but in other platforms that can bring in more users). Apps can actually see what platform you use to share the content, so the safest thing to do is not to click “copy link” but to actually share it to another app (hint: some apps allow you to set up a single-user group, which allows you to send it somewhere even if it's not going to be useful)
- Save it into a collection. I have a theory that a shared collection might be weighted more highly, given that it could attract the collection's users to open up the app.

## Dampen engagement on harmful content
- Don’t engage with bots or inflammatory content. It’s very tempting to argue with them and try to talk sense, but engagement-driven platforms like IG are not the place. These comments _will_ get boosted to the top of the comments section inadvertently. Try to take constructive conversations into the DMs, where your comments do not contribute to the comment's engagement metrics. I have a hunch that profile clicks are probably worth less to the comment's signals than a reply or a like.
- To add on to this, don’t engage with comments that make a very valid response or witty retort against harmful comments. This also drives engagement, and takes away valuable screen estate from constructive comments.
- In fact, you should ignore comments that are inflammatory. Don't even bother reporting them (which can be used as a signal if IG wanted to boost these comments). Pretend that you saw a really bad joke, or read something in a language that you don't understand. The time you spend reading a comment matters, so distribute your attention wisely.

## Don’t let the algorithm control what you see
Turn on notifications for posts, reels, stories. These are easier to send out and ensure that your news feed doesn’t obscure new content from Palestinian voices.
Join channels for journalists that have them. These are chronological and are less prone to algorithmic sabotage.
There’s a chance that any of these features can still be manipulated by the platform, so consider also following folks on decentralized platforms like Mastodon or Pixelfed.

## Archive content
- Some of the content that you come across may be useful to lawyers, historians, and journalists, so it might helpful for you to archive the content. For example, if you come across a prominent person encouraging genocidal activities or war crimes, it may be worth saving a screenshot.  It's best to use an external storage to archive such content. Remember, videos posted on TikTok is what enabled South Africa to build a strong case against Israel. 
- Record your screen or take a screenshot everytime you see something that is probably going to get taken down. It's our shared responsibility to keep this content alive.
- If you have the time, submit your content to various archiving websites (e.g. https://github.com/TechForPalestine/content-and-talks/blob/main/palestine-content.md) Keep these in mind when looking at content. 

## Make it hard to isolate our voices
If you're serious about this, and you should be, it means that business cannot go on as usual.
Business will not go on as usual, and we need to get used to this.

- Don't unfollow Palestinian voices, especially the folks who are on the ground. They need you now more than ever.
- Drop emojis, "Free Palestine" and call out influencers/celebs when you engage with "mainstream" content or adverisments. It keeps the resistance alive in our collective consciousness by using platforms like influencers and (already-paid-for) ads. Even if influencers stay silent, you don't. On the algorithmic side, the more you do this, the harder it is for IG to figure out what content they need to censor. Doing this also prevents our content from circulating in a bubble.
    - The inverse of this is true: if you see people not talking about Palestine on Palestinian content (e.g. saying that the post has a "great recipe"), don't talk about Palestine. This is people trying to get around censorship and use mainstream signals to boost the content.
- Don't use a separate account for this. It's important that IG cannot use your behavior to isolate and censor Palestinian content.
- If you’re reposting content that’s shadowbanned or restricted, record the video/image and post it. Severing that causal link makes it harder for IG to censor you, and they’ll have to do more video processing and manual intervention to review what you’re posting. Of course, give credit where it's due.
